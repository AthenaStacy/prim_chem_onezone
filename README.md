# prim_chem_onezone
This is a one-zone ('single AMR grid cell') version of the chemistry code incorporated into Orion2.  This follows the evolution of 
the abundance of a number of chemical species within primordial gas (H, H_2, H+, He, He+, He++, D, D+, D2, e- ...), as well as the
resulting change in temperature of that gas.
